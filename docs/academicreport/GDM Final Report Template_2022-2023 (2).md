vii The report should be divided into chapters each of which may be divided into  sections which may again 
be divided into subsections and so on. Each chapter  and numbered section should have a title, and the 
contents page should list the  most significant of these.  
 
You should use the styles Heading 1, Heading 2 Heading 3  for the main body of the report. You should 
use the Headings others  for the abstract, preface etc.  You should use the Headings for appendices  style 
for the appendices.  
 
Chapters should be numbered (1,2,…) and each section sub -numbered (2.1, 2.2,2.3…). Further 
decomposition into subsections should be numbered ( 2.2.1, 2.2.2,  2.2.3 and so on). Each chapter and 
numbered section or subsection should have  a title, and the contents page should list the most significant 
of these.  This will be done automatically if you use styles.  Please start each chapter on a   new pa ge 
 
To generate contents (you must have used the styles described above).

1 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
The first chapter of the report is commonly an introduction, which gives an account of the work to be 
done and the context in which it is to be done, usually providing background information  (referenced)  
justifying  the need for the work you have done. This should also include a clear statement of aims and 
objectives  (refer to your project proposal)  and the methods used in carrying out the work involved in 
each stage of the project.  
 
When discussing  your project it should be referred to in the pas t tense. It should be completed by the 
time the report is read  
 
“the project  investigated  the role of HCI in the design of web pages and resulted  in the creation of a 
web site for a doctors surgery.”  
 
When d iscussing the report it can be in the present or future tense.  
 
“this report  investigates  the role of HCI in the design of web pages and then describes  the 
implementation of a website for a doctors surgery”  
 
Line spacing should  be 1.5  
 
You should avoid us e of “I” “me” “you”  
e.g.  
NOT  
I investigated the use of motion capture in 3d animation and films.  
BUT  
The use of motion capture in 3d animation and films was investigated.  
 
NOT  
I think this is a really successful project  
BUT  
This project is successful beca use…

2 1.2 Aims and Objectives  
Aims are wider in scope than objectives and reflect the problem to be investigated.  
The objectives should all have specific deliverables and be measurable to help you evaluate how 
successful you have been in your work. (See the chapter headed Evaluation)  
 
1.3 Methodologies used in the project  
This should be a justification  not a detailed description. This will vary between projects  the key points 
should be about presenting evidence (i.e. references) as to why you chose your methodolo gies 
Why you used, for example, UML, UCD, personas, iterative prototyping, RAD.  
 
Once more you should have a section in the Evaluation chapter which reflects on the effectiveness of 
these methodologies in your specific project.  
 
1.4 Overview of report  
 
Finish the introduction with a section explaining what is to come in your report.

3 2 LITERATURE REVIEW  
2.1 Introduction  
 
The literature review will look at work carried out in the area previously in order to understand the 
problem and ensure that the work is wo rthwhile, and to show the best ways of creating a superior 
product.  
 
It is an improved version of what you created for your initial report.  
 
Try to avoid using quotes if at all possible  
“You don’t get any marks for quoting other people ” 
2.2 Some major area of research  
2.2.1 A key section of the research   
2.2.2 More key sections of the research  
Etc. etc.  
2.3 Another major area of research  
 
Etc. etc.  
2.4 Key issues to use in the design and imple mentation  
2.5 Conclusion

3.2 Product 1  
Review product . Use some appropriate level 3 headings  based on the criteria  for each product, for 
example:  
3.2.1 Overview  
3.2.2 Technology  
3.2.3 Usability  
 
3.3 Product 2  
 
3.4 Product 3

8 7 LEGAL , SOCIAL , ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL ISSUES  
 
These areas will overlap and you are not expected to be a legal expert, but you should show an awareness 
of what impact they may have had on your project.  
e.g.  
data protection act,   
research ethics,  
how people may react to your product.  
Copyright issues,  
health and sa fety 
Security  
Accessibility  
Offensiveness  
Accepted standards  
BCS Accreditation  
 
If this product were to be developed commercially what issues would there be?  
E.g. 
 Costs – money and time  
 Ownership of  … assets, data etc  
 Maintenance  
 Marketing and sales  
Scalability

11 REFERENCES  
References should be ordered alphabetically by  the name of the author (or, if there is more than one, the 
name of the first author. The Harvard system is used. Each reference should state the author’s name and 
initials, date (in parentheses), title, publisher and place of issue (if known) e.g. Seber G .A.F. (2003), 
Multivariate Observations, John Wiley, New York.  
 
If the reference is to a journal or to a conference proceedings article, then the journal title, volume, 
number and page numbers should be added, e.g. Parna s D.L. et al (2001), Evaluation of Safety Critical 
Software, CACM, Vol. 33, No.6, pp. 636 -651. 
 
Using internet sources you should ad the word “online” in brackets after the title of the work, plus the 
URL after the name of the publisher.

12 APPENDIX A -  Original Project Schedule  
You should have a week by  week schedule of your development work. If you changed it have the 
variations to show how you adapted. Refer to this in your evaluation chapter – reflecting on how well 
you kept to your schedule and why there were changes.  
 
1 Original schedule  
  
2 Revised schedule  
 
Have several appendices (A,B,C…). The se should include detailed and technical documentation such 
as table of results,  diagrams, program source code, etc, which are essential parts of the project but  not 
directly a part of the main discussion in the report. All contents of appendices  should be exclusively, 
products of the student’s own work.  
 
Other materials used during the project work (such as information from user  manuals, interview notes, 
etc), which it is necessary to include, s hould if possible  be summarized to only a few pages before 
entering into the appendix. Original  copies of such material should be kept by the student and may be 
required to be  produced as supporting evidence of their work.  
 
Examples of key coding  files  may be  provided in an Appendix but generally it should be  uploaded on 
Moodle
