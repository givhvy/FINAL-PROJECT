This needs to be read in conjunction with the lecture slides
Objectives are things described using nouns, either concrete nouns or abstract nouns. Some objectives are big and some objectives are small. All objectives must be SMART. Objectives are created by activities. Activities are described using verbs. An objective may be created by a single activity or by several activities. Activities take time. Provide a time estimate in days for each activity (as shown below in square brackets).

	3.1.2 Activity verb [0.2]
	3.1.3 Activity verb [2.1]

APPENDIX A - SCHEDULE OF WORK

This should show the schedule of tasks, associated descriptions and mini-deadlines. Remember failure to plan, is planning to fail.  It is much harder without a detailed plan – as many students will testify to.
