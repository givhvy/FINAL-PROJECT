1	Overview
Nowadays, mobile, touchscreen device, internet are no longer unfamiliar concepts. More on more people are using smartphone, tablet for their work and entertainment. NetCitizens’ report points out that devices used for connecting online are increasing from laptop, mobile phone and tablet in Vietnam (Cimigo, 2012). Each platform for mobile has its own language which uses to develop native application. Under the need of a hybrid language, HTML5 came to the world. With HTML5, advanced Web application features are available in all mobile browsers supporting the mark-up language, using the same standard syntax and displaying the same standard behaviour (Warner, 2010). Rising up of a technology for cross-platform application like HTML5 is interesting and attractive enough to involve developers exploring it.
In this project, I will firstly focus on analysing the supporting features of HTML5 in animation, audio, storage for mobile game and the theory of game programming. Secondly, I will investigate a free JavaScript engine to build HTML5 game as a native application for popular mobile platform such as iOS, Android, Windows Phone. Then I will go to detail in the process to implement a turn-based strategy game as an example for my research. Finally, a review is taken to check out whether I match my objectives.
