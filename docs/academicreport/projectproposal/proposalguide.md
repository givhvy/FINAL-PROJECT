Answer these questions:
a.	What is the system that you are developing?

e.	Explanation of major keywords in your project

2	Aim
Your project should ideally have a single aim stated in a one or a few sentences.
For example: This project is to investigate about the [technology name(s)] and its/their applications in developing [application name].
3	Objectives
This needs to be read in conjunction with the lecture slides
Objectives are things described using nouns, either concrete nouns or abstract nouns.
Some objectives are big and some objectives are small. All objectives must be SMART. Objectives are created by activities. Activities are described using verbs. An objective may be created by a single activity or by several activities. Activities take time. Provide a time estimate in days for each activity (as shown below in square brackets).
The objectives normally are: Initial investigation, analysis, design, code, test, evaluation, writing report,…
Activities: the tasks that you do in order to complete your objectives.
Deliverables: the document/chapter/software component/or a result of the corresponding activities that you do in each objective (or the thing that you achieve in the objective).
You should also use Work Break Down Structure to find out Objectives and Activities accordingly.

6	Initial References
On what material have you based the ideas discussed in this proposal? Identify your sources in Harvard formatting.


 
APPENDIX A - SCHEDULE OF WORK

This should show the schedule of tasks, associated descriptions and mini-deadlines. Remember failure to plan, is planning to fail.  It is much harder without a detailed plan – as many students will testify to.
