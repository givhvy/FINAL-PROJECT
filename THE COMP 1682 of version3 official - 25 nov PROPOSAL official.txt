1. Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital education adoption, exposing critical fragmentation in existing Learning Management Systems. Traditional platforms like Moodle and Blackboard force users to navigate multiple disconnected tools for content delivery, assessment, and payment processing. UniLearn addresses these challenges by developing an integrated web-based LMS combining institutional functionality with consumer-grade usability.
The system employs modern full-stack technologies: Node.js/Express.js backend with Firebase Firestore NoSQL database, EJS templating, and Tailwind CSS responsive UI. Key integrations include Google OAuth 2.0 authentication, Stripe subscription payments ($9.99/month Pro tier), Cloudinary media CDN, and Vercel serverless deployment. The MVC architecture supports three user roles (Students, Teachers, Administrators) with comprehensive Role-Based Access Control.
Core features include course creation, multimedia lessons with progress tracking, interactive quizzes with automated grading, analytics dashboards, automated certificate generation, and gamified community features (study groups, leaderboards). Security implements OWASP Top 10 compliance through bcrypt hashing, JWT authentication, HTTPS enforcement, and PCI DSS compliance via Stripe.
This project demonstrates industry-standard practices including RESTful API design, OAuth integration, secure payment processing, and cloud deployment strategies, targeting small-to-medium educational institutions seeking affordable alternatives to expensive enterprise LMS solutions.


2. Aim
To design, develop, and evaluate a comprehensive web-based responsive e-learning platform demonstrating modern full-stack development practices while providing an integrated, secure, and user-friendly environment addressing fragmentation in current LMS offerings.

4. Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues
Legal
* GDPR Compliance: Personal data processing requires user consent, data minimization, and right to erasure. Privacy policy explains data storage in Firebase and sharing with Google OAuth/Stripe.
* Copyright: Teachers certify content ownership. DMCA takedown procedures for infringement. Original code under MIT License.
* PCI DSS: Stripe Checkout avoids direct card handling, ensuring payment security compliance.


Social
* Digital Divide: Freemium model (3 free courses) ensures basic access regardless of financial capacity.
* Accessibility: Targets WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
* Quality Assurance: No teacher verification in MVP, future peer review system planned.


Ethical
* Academic Integrity: Quiz system lacks proctoring. Mitigation through randomized questions and time limits.
* Data Ethics: Transparent progress tracking with no hidden predictive analytics.
* Own Effort: Project represents independent work with supervisor guidance. All sources properly cited.


Professional
* Confidentiality: No disclosure of proprietary information without University permission.
* Integrity: Honest reporting of limitations (scalability constraints, security trade-offs).
* Respect: Value alternative perspectives and accept constructive criticism.
